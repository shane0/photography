# astrophotography

- I use my wife's 400mm S lens for this usually
- my compact camera effectively makes a 600mm photo that even shows in the meta data
- I never knew our cameras could do this it was a wonderful surprise
- I plan to return to a place I camped with a friend
- we saw an amazing milky way this was bicycling the iron horse trail
- I plan to return there and do an extended shutter exposure for that
- I might even invest in the motorized tripod so you can get a really long exposure
